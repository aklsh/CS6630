abstract="In this paper we present a differential fault attack that can be applied to the AES using a single fault. We demonstrate that when a single random byte fault is induced at the input of the eighth round, the AES key can be deduced using a two stage algorithm. The first step has a statistical expectation of reducing the possible key hypotheses to 232, and the second step to a mere 28.",
